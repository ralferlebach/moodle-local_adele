/**
 * Code to be executed after the plugin's database scheme has been installed is defined here.
 *
 * Uses the Moodle role APIs — create_role(), set_role_contextlevels() and
 * assign_capability() — rather than writing directly into the {role},
 * {role_context_levels} and {role_capabilities} core tables, so sortorder,
 * modifierid and cache invalidation are handled correctly. Both roles
 * previously got the same literal "Adele assistant" description regardless
 * of which one was being created.
 *
 * Regression fix (confirmed against a real Moodle 4.5.12 instance, same
 * session): xmldb_local_adele_install() runs BEFORE Moodle applies this
 * plugin's own db/access.php into {capabilities} — assign_capability()
 * validates the capability exists there first and throws a coding_exception
 * if it does not, which a fresh install always hits for this plugin's own
 * capabilities. The original raw {role_capabilities} insert this code used
 * to have deliberately worked around exactly this ordering gotcha by
 * skipping that validation. create_role()/set_role_contextlevels() have no
 * such dependency and stay on the proper API; capability assignment now
 * checks whether the capability is registered yet and only uses
 * assign_capability() when it is (its validation, cache invalidation and
 * event trigger are still preferable in that case, e.g. a later upgrade
 * where the capability already exists) — otherwise it falls back to the
 * same direct insert as before, which does not require the capability
 * definition to exist first.
